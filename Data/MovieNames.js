He was inspired by the life story of publishing scion William Randolph Hearst, but you’ll have to watch it to see what exactly “Rosebud” means. ",

It also changed showers forever. Anthony Perkins’s Norman Bates is still one of the most memorable screen weirdos of all-time, and Bernard Herrmann’s screeching strings left a lasting influence on movie scores.',
